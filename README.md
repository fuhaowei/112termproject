# 112termproject

p.s. coming back to this 1 year later - it's nice to see how much progress i've made with programming! the code here is going to be rougher for sure - might come back to work on it, but good documentation of this first programming project i've made in my life

Video Demo: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDoz0RS2DoE

Project Name: psst. hey. let me guess.

Project Description: Guessing your MBTI personality based on what you listen to on Spotify, then exploring the results and your music taste via a side-scroller game. 

How to Run: Log in to  https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/login, create an app, copy down the client ID/clientSecret and enter it when you are prompted to on my app. Also include http://localhost:8888/callback as an redirect URL in the settings page for your app on the spotify for developers dashboard!

What Libraries Are Needed: json, spotipy, spotipy.ouath2, cmu_112_graphics.
Libaries are included in submission file.

Shortcut commands: use 2 and 8 to travel to the edge of the top and bottom screen respectively, same thing for 4 and 6 to the left and right of the screen so you can travel across screens faster.
